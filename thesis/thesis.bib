@article{person_organization_fit,
  abstract = {To investigate job seekers' and new employees' subjective person--organization (P-O) fit perceptions, we studied 96 active job seekers across three time periods, from their initial job search activity to their intended turnover from the jobs they accepted. Hypotheses were motivated by P-O fit, job choice, and organizational entry research and centered around two questions: What are the determinants of job seekers' and new employees' P-O fit perceptions, and how important are P-O fit perceptions in job choice decisions and work attitudes relative to job attributes? Results indicated that job seekers' P-O fit perceptions are predicted by the congruence between their values and their perceptions of recruiting organizations' values but not by their demographic similarity with organizational representatives. Results also suggested that P-O fit perceptions predict both job choice intentions and work attitudes, even after controlling for the attractiveness of job attributes. Finally, results suggested that job seekers can manage their future work attitudes by weighing P-O fit in their job choice decisions.},

  abstract = { There is a substantial gap between the promise and reality of artificial intelligence in human resource (HR) management. This article identifies four challenges in using data science techniques for HR tasks: complexity of HR phenomena, constraints imposed by small data sets, accountability questions associated with fairness and other ethical and legal constraints, and possible adverse employee reactions to management decisions via data-based algorithms. It then proposes practical responses to these challenges based on three overlapping principles---causal reasoning, randomization and experiments, and employee contribution---that would be both economically efficient and socially appropriate for using data science in the management of employees. },

With the appropriate requirements in place, algorithms create the potential for new forms of transparency and hence opportunities to detect discrimination that are otherwise unavailable. The specificity of algorithms also makes transparent tradeoffs among competing values. This implies algorithms are not only a threat to be regulated; with the right safeguards, they can be a potential positive force for equity.}",

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.}

  abstract = {The widespread use of online recruitment services has led to an information explosion in the job market. As a result, recruiters have to seek intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right candidates to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit usually focus on measuring the matching degree between talent qualification and job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts, which could be easily misguided by the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of human judgment. To that end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Topic-based Ability-aware Person-Job Fit Neural Network (TAPJFNN) framework, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labor and can provide better interpretability about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available in abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers’ experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, two hierarchical topic-based ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measure the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. In addition, we design a refinement strategy for Person-Job Fit prediction based on historical recruitment records. Furthermore, we introduce how to exploit our TAPJFNN framework for enabling two specific applications in talent recruitment: talent sourcing and job recommendation. Particularly, in the application of job recommendation, a novel training mechanism is designed for addressing the challenge of biased negative labels. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the TAPJFNN and its variants compared with several baselines.},

  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Opening job vacancies using the Internet will receive many applications quickly. Manually filtering resumes takes a lot of time and incurs huge costs. In addition, this manual screening process tends to be inaccurate due to fatigue conditions and fails in obtaining the right candidate for the job. This paper proposed a solution to automatically generate the most suitable candidate from the application document. In this study, 126 application documents from a private company were used for the experiment. The documents consist of 41 documents for Human Resource and Development (HRD) staff, 42 documents for IT (Data Developer), and 43 documents for the Marketing position. Text Processing is implemented to extract relevant information such as skills, education, experiences from the unstructured resumes and summarize each application. A specific dictionary for each vacancy is generated based on terms used in each profession. Two methods are implemented and compared to match and score the application document, namely Document Vector and N-gram analysis. The highest the score obtained by one document, the highest the possibility of application to be accepted. The two methods' results are then validated by the real selection process by the company. The highest accuracy was achieved by the N-Gram method in IT vacancy with 87,5%, while the Document Vector showed 75% accuracy. For Marketing staff vacancy, both methods achieved the same accuracy as 78%. In HRD staff vacancy, the N-Gram method showed 68%, while Document Vector showed 74%. In conclusion, overall the N-gram method showed slightly better accuracy compared to the Document Vector method.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.}

@article{marketing_ai_recruitment,
	abstract = {Organizations are beginning to adopt and capitalize on the functionality of AI in their recruitment processes. However, little is known about how potential candidates regard the use of AI as part of the recruitment process and whether or not it influences their likelihood to apply for a job. Our research finds that attitudes towards organizations that use AI in the recruitment process, significantly influences the likelihood that potential candidates will complete the application process. The novelty factor of using AI in the recruitment process, mediates and further positively influences job application likelihood. These positive relationships between attitudes towards the use of AI in the recruitment process and the likelihood of applying for a job have several important practical implications. First, it means that whilst anxiety is naturally present when AI is part of the recruitment process, the anxiety doesn't really affect the completion of job applications and therefore, organizations do not need to spend money on either hiding their use of AI or reducing the anxiety levels of potential candidates. To the contrary, the research suggests that organizations do not need to hide their use of AI in fear of alienating potential candidates, rather organizations may want to promote their use of AI in the recruitment process and focus on potential candidates that already have positive views of both the organization and AI.},

@article{applicant_semantic_matching,
	abstract = {In this work we present a novel approach for evaluating job applicants in online recruitment systems, using machine learning algorithms to solve the candidate ranking problem and performing semantic matching techniques. An application of our approach is implemented in the form of a prototype system, whose functionality is showcased and evaluated in a real-world recruitment scenario. The proposed system extracts a set of objective criteria from the applicants'LinkedIn profile, and compares them semantically to the job's prerequisites. It also infers their personality characteristics using linguistic analysis on their blog posts. Our system was found to perform consistently compared to human recruiters, thus it can be trusted for the automation of applicant ranking and personality mining.},

The episode raised concerns over the use of machine learning in hiring software that would perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases.},

@article{ai_hrm_review,
	abstract = { Although academic production in intelligent automation (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics) has grown rapidly, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of the utilization of these technologies in human resource management (HRM) at an organizational (firms) and individual (employees) level. This study therefore aims to systematize the academic inputs on intelligent automation so far and to clarify what are its main contributions to and challenges for HRM. In a systematic search of 13,136 potentially relevant studies published in the top HRM, international business (IB), general management (GM) and information management (IM) journals, we found 45 articles studying artificial intelligence, robotics and other advanced technologies within HRM settings. Results show that intelligent automation technologies constitute a new approach to managing employees and enhancing firm performance, thus offering several opportunities for HRM but also considerable challenges at a technological and ethical level. The impact of these technologies has been identified to concentrate on HRM strategies, namely, job replacement, human-robot/AI collaboration, decision-making and learning opportunities, and HRM activities, namely, recruiting, training and job performance. This study discusses these shifts in detail, along with the main contributions to theory and practice and directions for future research. },

  abstract = {With the widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for fairness has gained significant importance in designing and engineering of such systems. AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

  abstract = {We address a relatively under-explored aspect of human-computer interaction: people's abilities to understand the relationship between a machine learning model's stated performance on held-out data and its expected performance post deployment. We conduct large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine whether laypeople's trust in a model, measured in terms of both the frequency with which they revise their predictions to match those of the model and their self-reported levels of trust in the model, varies depending on the model's stated accuracy on held-out data and on its observed accuracy in practice. We find that people's trust in a model is affected by both its stated accuracy and its observed accuracy, and that the effect of stated accuracy can change depending on the observed accuracy. Our work relates to recent research on interpretable machine learning, but moves beyond the typical focus on model internals, exploring a different component of the machine learning pipeline.},

@article{ai_reliability,
	abstract = {One of the main difficulties in assessing artificial intelligence (AI) is the tendency for people to anthropomorphise it. This becomes particularly problematic when we attach human moral activities to AI. For example, the European Commission's High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEG) have adopted the position that we should establish a relationship of trust with AI and should cultivate trustworthy AI (HLEG AI Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI, 2019, p. 35). Trust is one of the most important and defining activities in human relationships, so proposing that AI should be trusted, is a very serious claim. This paper will show that AI cannot be something that has the capacity to be trusted according to the most prevalent definitions of trust because it does not possess emotive states or can be held responsible for their actions---requirements of the affective and normative accounts of trust. While AI meets all of the requirements of the rational account of trust, it will be shown that this is not actually a type of trust at all, but is instead, a form of reliance. Ultimately, even complex machines such as AI should not be viewed as trustworthy as this undermines the value of interpersonal trust, anthropomorphises AI, and diverts responsibility from those developing and using them.},

  abstract = { Transparency is now a fundamental principle for data processing under the General Data Protection Regulation. We explore what this requirement entails for artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems. We address the topic of transparency in artificial intelligence by integrating legal, social, and ethical aspects. We first investigate the ratio legis of the transparency requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation and its ethical underpinnings, showing its focus on the provision of information and explanation. We then discuss the pitfalls with respect to this requirement by focusing on the significance of contextual and performative factors in the implementation of transparency. We show that human–computer interaction and human-robot interaction literature do not provide clear results with respect to the benefits of transparency for users of artificial intelligence technologies due to the impact of a wide range of contextual factors, including performative aspects. We conclude by integrating the information- and explanation-based approach to transparency with the critical contextual approach, proposing that transparency as required by the General Data Protection Regulation in itself may be insufficient to achieve the positive goals associated with transparency. Instead, we propose to understand transparency relationally, where information provision is conceptualized as communication between technology providers and users, and where assessments of trustworthiness based on contextual factors mediate the value of transparency communications. This relational concept of transparency points to future research directions for the study of transparency in artificial intelligence systems and should be taken into account in policymaking.}

  abstract = {As predictive models increasingly assist human experts (e.g., doctors) in day-to-day decision making, it is crucial for experts to be able to explore and understand how such models behave in different feature subspaces in order to know if and when to trust them. To this end, we propose Model Understanding through Subspace Explanations (MUSE), a novel model agnostic framework which facilitates understanding of a given black box model by explaining how it behaves in subspaces characterized by certain features of interest. Our framework provides end users (e.g., doctors) with the flexibility of customizing the model explanations by allowing them to input the features of interest. The construction of explanations is guided by a novel objective function that we propose to simultaneously optimize for fidelity to the original model, unambiguity and interpretability of the explanation. More specifically, our objective allows us to learn, with optimality guarantees, a small number of compact decision sets each of which captures the behavior of a given black box model in unambiguous, well-defined regions of the feature space. Experimental evaluation with real-world datasets and user studies demonstrate that our approach can generate customizable, highly compact, easy-to-understand, yet accurate explanations of various kinds of predictive models compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) has been a prominent area of research within Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML uses mathematical models to recognize patterns in large and complex data sets to aid decision making in different application areas, such as image and speech recognition, consumer recommendations, fraud detection and more. ML systems typically go through a training period in which the system encounters and learns about the data; further, this training often requires some degree of human intervention. Interactive machine learning (IML) refers to ML applications that depend on continuous user interaction. From an HCI perspective, how humans interact with and experience ML models in training is the main focus of this workshop proposal. In this workshop we focus on the user experience (UX) of Interactive Machine Learning, a topic with implications not only for usability but also for the long-term success of the IML systems themselves.},

@article{cx_ai_recruiting,

This has been driven by shifts in the source of firm value and competitive advantage and the critical role of human capital in those shifts. Technological advances have moved digital, AI-enabled recruiting from a peripheral curiosity to a critical capability. However, we know little about candidates' reactions to AI-enabled recruiting. Consequently, in this study, we examine the role of social media use, intrinsic rewards, fair treatment, and perceived trendiness on the intentions of prospective employees to engage with and complete digital, AI-enabled recruiting processes. The positive relationships between these factors and candidates' engagement with AI-enabled recruiting have several important practical implications for managers. We also examine the larger implications and make general recommendations to firms about using AI-enabled recruiting technology and tools.},
