@article{person_organization_fit,
  abstract = {To investigate job seekers' and new employees' subjective person--organization (P-O) fit perceptions, we studied 96 active job seekers across three time periods, from their initial job search activity to their intended turnover from the jobs they accepted. Hypotheses were motivated by P-O fit, job choice, and organizational entry research and centered around two questions: What are the determinants of job seekers' and new employees' P-O fit perceptions, and how important are P-O fit perceptions in job choice decisions and work attitudes relative to job attributes? Results indicated that job seekers' P-O fit perceptions are predicted by the congruence between their values and their perceptions of recruiting organizations' values but not by their demographic similarity with organizational representatives. Results also suggested that P-O fit perceptions predict both job choice intentions and work attitudes, even after controlling for the attractiveness of job attributes. Finally, results suggested that job seekers can manage their future work attitudes by weighing P-O fit in their job choice decisions.},

  abstract = { There is a substantial gap between the promise and reality of artificial intelligence in human resource (HR) management. This article identifies four challenges in using data science techniques for HR tasks: complexity of HR phenomena, constraints imposed by small data sets, accountability questions associated with fairness and other ethical and legal constraints, and possible adverse employee reactions to management decisions via data-based algorithms. It then proposes practical responses to these challenges based on three overlapping principles---causal reasoning, randomization and experiments, and employee contribution---that would be both economically efficient and socially appropriate for using data science in the management of employees. },

The specificity of algorithms also makes transparent tradeoffs among competing values.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a comprehensive analytics framework that can serve as a decision support tool for HR recruiters in real-world settings in order to improve hiring and placement decisions. The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.}

  abstract = {The widespread use of online recruitment services has led to an information explosion in the job market. As a result, recruiters have to seek intelligent ways for Person-Job Fit, which is the bridge for adapting the right candidates to the right positions. Existing studies on Person-Job Fit usually focus on measuring the matching degree between talent qualification and job requirements mainly based on the manual inspection of human resource experts, which could be easily misguided by the subjective, incomplete, and inefficient nature of human judgment. To that end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Topic-based Ability-aware Person-Job Fit Neural Network (TAPJFNN) framework, which has a goal of reducing the dependence on manual labor and can provide better interpretability about the fitting results. The key idea is to exploit the rich information available in abundant historical job application data. Specifically, we propose a word-level semantic representation for both job requirements and job seekers’ experiences based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Along this line, two hierarchical topic-based ability-aware attention strategies are designed to measure the different importance of job requirements for semantic representation, as well as measure the different contribution of each job experience to a specific ability requirement. In addition, we design a refinement strategy for Person-Job Fit prediction based on historical recruitment records. Furthermore, we introduce how to exploit our TAPJFNN framework for enabling two specific applications in talent recruitment: talent sourcing and job recommendation. Particularly, in the application of job recommendation, a novel training mechanism is designed for addressing the challenge of biased negative labels. Finally, extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness and interpretability of the TAPJFNN and its variants compared with several baselines.},

  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Opening job vacancies using the Internet will receive many applications quickly. Manually filtering resumes takes a lot of time and incurs huge costs. In addition, this manual screening process tends to be inaccurate due to fatigue conditions and fails in obtaining the right candidate for the job. This paper proposed a solution to automatically generate the most suitable candidate from the application document. In this study, 126 application documents from a private company were used for the experiment. The documents consist of 41 documents for Human Resource and Development (HRD) staff, 42 documents for IT (Data Developer), and 43 documents for the Marketing position. Text Processing is implemented to extract relevant information such as skills, education, experiences from the unstructured resumes and summarize each application. A specific dictionary for each vacancy is generated based on terms used in each profession. Two methods are implemented and compared to match and score the application document, namely Document Vector and N-gram analysis. The highest the score obtained by one document, the highest the possibility of application to be accepted. The two methods' results are then validated by the real selection process by the company. The highest accuracy was achieved by the N-Gram method in IT vacancy with 87,5%, while the Document Vector showed 75% accuracy. For Marketing staff vacancy, both methods achieved the same accuracy as 78%. In HRD staff vacancy, the N-Gram method showed 68%, while Document Vector showed 74%. In conclusion, overall the N-gram method showed slightly better accuracy compared to the Document Vector method.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

First, as competitive advantages have shifted from tangible to intangible assets, human capital has transitioned from supporting cast to a starring role. Second, as digitalization has redesigned both the business and social landscapes, digital recruiting of human capital has moved from the periphery to center stage. Third, recent and near-future advances in AI-enabled recruiting have improved recruiting efficiency to the point that managers ignore them or procrastinate their utilization at their own peril. In addition to explaining the forces that have pushed AI-enabled recruiting systems from nice to necessary, we outline the key strategic steps managers need to take in order to capture its main benefits.},

  abstract = {Ranked lists are encountered in research and daily life and it is often of interest to compare these lists even when they are incomplete or have only some members in common. An example is document rankings returned for the same query by different search engines. A measure of the similarity between incomplete rankings should handle nonconjointness, weight high ranks more heavily than low, and be monotonic with increasing depth of evaluation; but no measure satisfying all these criteria currently exists. In this article, we propose a new measure having these qualities, namely rank-biased overlap (RBO). The RBO measure is based on a simple probabilistic user model. It provides monotonicity by calculating, at a given depth of evaluation, a base score that is non-decreasing with additional evaluation, and a maximum score that is nonincreasing. An extrapolated score can be calculated between these bounds if a point estimate is required. RBO has a parameter which determines the strength of the weighting to top ranks. We extend RBO to handle tied ranks and rankings of different lengths. Finally, we give examples of the use of the measure in comparing the results produced by public search engines and in assessing retrieval systems in the laboratory.}
